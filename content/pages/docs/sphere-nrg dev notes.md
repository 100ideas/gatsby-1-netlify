misc ideas 
- hackerspaces federated api 
  - https://spaceapi.io 
  - also w/ automated update crawler? https://github.com/SpaceApi/directory-api/blob/master/collector/main.go
- orgs have some way of adding updates or sub-elements to their sphere page, or better configuring sphere to subscribe to sources and create these automatically
  - this forms a pulse of dated events 
- get discourse forum integrated w/ google group and sphere

## netlify-cms troubleshooting: remove localstorate `nelifySiteUrl` key
'localStorage.removeItem("netlifySiteURL");'
- https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms/issues/58

### resolution
- delete all complex app state entries from local storage
- delete identity instance on netlify
- ~~add 'repo' key to config.yaml w/ github repo~~
  - this couldn't have affected the deployed site b/c I forgot to push the change
- delete all gatsby prod file
- go to https://hardcore-jennings-13cefd.netlify.app/
  - sign up for email first
